    "<h3><b><i>Background</i></b></h3>\n",
    "The tabletop gaming industry, which include board games, has experienced a resurgence in popularity during the late 2000s [1]. The estimated global market for board games was approximately 7.6 billion USD in 2017 with the potential to rise to 12 billion USD by 2023 [2].  As of 2021, there were 1,288 pages of board games listed on Board Game Geek with 100 games per each page to view [3]. With so many board games now available, selecting one to purchase can be difficult. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h3><b><i>Goal</i></b></h3>\n",
    "The goal of this case study is to recommend board games based on specified criteria. For example, a customer wants to play the top rated board game; what game meets this criteria? You will use attributes such as the rank of the game, the average rating of the game, the number of user ratings, and the minimum and maximum number of players to make recommendations on a game to purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you work through this case study you will practice concepts you have learned such in DataCamp's <a href=\"https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science\">Introduction to Python</a> and <a href=\"https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/data-science-for-everyone\">Data Science for Everyone</a> such as: storing data as <b><i>Variables</i></b>, working with data structures such as a <b><i>List</i></b>, and importing various <b><i>Python Libraries</i></b>.\n",
